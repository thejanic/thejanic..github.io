        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">11. Copyright Policy</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-9"><span class="C-5">1. The JaNic<span class="C-4"> respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In appropriate circumstances and at its sole discretion, we may terminate and/or disable the Membership of users who we suspect have infringed on the copyrights (or other intellectual property rights) of others. Additionally, in appropriate circumstances and in our sole discretion, </span>The JaNic<span class="C-4"> may remove or disable access to material on our Website or hosted on our systems that may be infringing or the subject of infringing activity.</span></span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">2. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 (“DMCA”), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have designated to receive notifications of claims infringement (“Designated Agent”). <span class="C-5">The JaNic</span>'s Designated Agent is:</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-8"><span class="C-4">The JaNic &nbsp;<br>P.O. Box 602, Houston, Texas, 77056-<wbr>6564, United States of America <br>ATTN: Legal Department (W3-<wbr>Copyright)</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">3. If you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and believe that your work's copyright has been infringed, please report your notice of infringement to us by providing our Designated Agent with a written notification of claimed infringement that includes substantially the following: </span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-8"><span class="C-4">We will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the DMCA. Inquiries that do not follow this procedure may not receive a response.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">12. Choice of Law</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-5"><span class="C-4">These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. Any action arising out of your use of the Website or these Terms of Use shall be brought in any state or federal court located in Harris County, Texas. </span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">13. Dispute Resolution</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-5"><span class="C-4">This section outlines the method by which any disputes that might arise between you and <span class="C-5">The JaNic</span> (hereinafter, jointly the ”Parties” and each individually a “Party”) shall be resolved.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">1. The Parties agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at the address provided below. Conversely, we will contact you based on the contact information that you have provided us.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">2. The Parties agree to finally settle all disputes (as defined and subject to any specific exceptions below) only by binding arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and review is limited. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief, including any attorney’s fees authorized by law. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The Parties also agree as follows:</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">1. “Disputes” are any claims against or controversies involving a Party related in any way to our Website, Website Content or these Terms of Use. This includes claims you bring against <span class="C-5">The JaNic</span>’s employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives, and claims <span class="C-5">The JaNic</span> may bring against you.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">2. Any Party wishing to arbitrate a dispute, agrees to send written notice to the other Party providing a description of the dispute, previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documents/information, and the proposed resolution. We will send notice to you based on the contact information you have provided us and notice to us must be sent to: The JaNic, P.O.&nbsp;Box&nbsp;602, Houston, Texas 77056-<wbr>6564, United States of America, ATTN: Legal Department. Parties agree to make reasonable attempts to resolve any disputes. If a dispute cannot be resolved within forty-<wbr>five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then we may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">3. The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. The Parties agree that the FAA's provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">4. The arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration Forum (“NAF”) under its arbitration rules. If any NAF rule conflicts with these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use shall apply. You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the NAF at +1&nbsp;(800)&nbsp;474-<wbr>2371 or www.adrforum.com.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">5. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in Harris County, Texas, United States of America. The federal or state law that applies to these Terms of Use will also apply during the arbitration.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">6. The Parties agree not to pursue Arbitration on a class-<wbr>wide basis and also agree that any arbitration will be solely between the Parties, <span class="C-8">i.e.</span>, not brought on behalf of or together with other individuals’ claims. If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the dispute must be brought before the courts.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-7"><span class="C-4">7. Each Party is responsible for its respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses as well as any other costs related to arbitration. The Party raising a dispute and issuing the notice to arbitrate will be responsible for arbitration administrative/filing fees.</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">14. No Class Actions</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-5"><span class="C-4">To the extent allowed by law, the Parties waive any right to pursue disputes on a class-<wbr>wide basis; that is, to either join a claim with the claim of any other person or entity, or assert a claim in a representative capacity on behalf of anyone else in any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding. </span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">15. No Trial By Jury</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-5"><span class="C-4">To the extent allowed by law, the Parties waive any right to trial by jury in any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding. </span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">16. Amendment; Additional Terms</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">1.

        <p class="Normal4 P-4"><span class="C-5">17. Miscellaneous</span></p>
        <p class="Normal4 P-6"><span class="C-4">1. No waiver by either Party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.

These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the Parties with respect to such subject matter. </span></p>
